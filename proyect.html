                    <h3>Project Details</h3>
                    <p>For my final master’s project, I developed a video game environment concept focused on visual
                        storytelling and atmosphere. The project features two contrasting biomes: a vast desert
                        landscape and a frozen Arctic setting. Each environment was designed to convey a distinct mood
                        and narrative, using light, color, and composition to immerse the player in the world.

                        The two locations are connected through magical portals, allowing players to travel between
                        extreme climates and explore how each environment reflects different story elements. My process
                        included concept sketches, layout exploration, and moodboards, followed by detailed
                        illustrations developed in Photoshop and 3D support using Blender for composition and lighting
                        references.

                        This project allowed me to combine my passion for environment storytelling, worldbuilding, and
                        gameplay integration, while pushing my technical and artistic skills in the development of
                        immersive digital spaces.</p>

                    <h3>Project Details</h3>
                    <p>In addition to my final master's project, I developed several other works focused on both
                        character and environment design, using a combination of 3D sculpting, photobashing, and digital
                        painting:

                        Miles Morales Character Illustration: I created a 3D sculpt of Miles in ZBrush to define
                        anatomy, pose, and expression. This served as the base for a dynamic illustration, where I used
                        photobashing and overpainting in Photoshop to place the character in an urban setting with
                        stylized lighting, textures, and motion elements inspired by comic and cinematic visuals.

                        Forest Cabin Scene: A peaceful, storytelling-driven environment centered around a wooden cabin
                        beside a forest lake. The scene explores mood, depth, and nature, with attention to composition,
                        lighting, and atmospheric perspective.

                        Castle Entrance Concept: A grand, fantasy-themed illustration featuring the entrance of a
                        monumental castle. I used 3D blocking for architecture and perspective, then enhanced the scene
                        with hand-painted details, photorealistic textures, and cinematic lighting.

                        These projects allowed me to refine a hybrid workflow that combines ZBrush sculpting, 2D
                        painting, and photorealistic elements to create visually rich and storytelling-oriented concept
                        art for games and media.</p>

                    <h3>Project Details</h3>
                    <p>n addition to my concept art work, I have developed several 3D character and environment projects
                        that allowed me to explore a full production workflow from sculpt to render. These projects were
                        created using the following pipeline:

                        ZBrush for high-resolution sculpting

                        Maya for retopology and clean mesh preparation

                        Mixamo for automatic rigging and posing

                        Substance Painter for texture painting and materials

                        Marvelous Designer for realistic cloth simulation

                        Blender for environment modeling and scene layout

                        Marmoset Toolbag for final rendering and presentation

                        Some of the completed character projects include:

                        An elven archer, focused on graceful anatomy and layered costuming

                        A stylized rabbit, with an expressive pose and cartoon-inspired textures

                        Sara, a modern character concept based on a bass guitarist, blending urban style and attitude

                        A fantasy king, wearing ornate robes and accessories designed to convey power and elegance

                        Each project helped me refine my understanding of the 3D pipeline, from anatomical sculpting and
                        clothing to posing, texturing, and presentation. I particularly enjoy combining realism and
                        stylization, bringing characters and environments to life in a visually engaging and technically
                        polished way.</p>

                    <h3>Project Details</h3>
                    <p>As part of my undergraduate final project, I developed a narrative-driven detective game using
                        Unity. The goal of the game is to solve a mini murder case by exploring different suspect
                        locations, gathering clues, and analyzing evidence to identify the killer.

                        The player moves between interactive environments, such as rooms in each suspect’s home, where
                        they can investigate objects, read documents, and uncover hidden items. The game features simple
                        inventory logic, dialogue sequences, and progressive clue unlocking that leads to the final
                        deduction.

                        This project allowed me to combine game design, storytelling, and programming, focusing on
                        player agency and logical thinking. It was built entirely in Unity, with C# scripts handling
                        object interactions, dialogue triggers, and state changes across the investigation.

                        This experience strengthened my understanding of game logic, scene management, and event
                        systems, while also highlighting how narrative and mechanics can work together to deliver an
                        engaging gameplay experience.</p>
