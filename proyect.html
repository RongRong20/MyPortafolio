                        <h3>Project Details</h3>
                        <p>For my final master's project, I developed a video game environment concept focused on visual
                            storytelling and atmosphere. The project features two contrasting biomes: a vast desert
                            landscape and a frozen Arctic setting. Each environment was designed to convey a distinct mood
                            and narrative, using light, color, and composition to immerse the player in the world.

                            The two locations are connected through magical portals, allowing players to travel between
                            extreme climates and explore how each environment reflects different story elements. My process
                            included concept sketches, layout exploration, and moodboards, followed by detailed
                            illustrations developed in Photoshop and 3D support using Blender for composition and lighting
                            references.

                            This project allowed me to combine my passion for environment storytelling, worldbuilding, and
                            gameplay integration, while pushing my technical and artistic skills in the development of
                            immersive digital spaces.</p>

                        <h3>Project Details</h3>
                        <p>In addition to my final master's project, I developed several other works focused on both
                            character and environment design, using a combination of 3D sculpting, photobashing, and digital
                            painting:

                            Miles Morales Character Illustration: I created a 3D sculpt of Miles in ZBrush to define
                            anatomy, pose, and expression. This served as the base for a dynamic illustration, where I used
                            photobashing and overpainting in Photoshop to place the character in an urban setting with
                            stylized lighting, textures, and motion elements inspired by comic and cinematic visuals.

                            Forest Cabin Scene: A peaceful, storytelling-driven environment centered around a wooden cabin
                            beside a forest lake. The scene explores mood, depth, and nature, with attention to composition,
                            lighting, and atmospheric perspective.

                            Castle Entrance Concept: A grand, fantasy-themed illustration featuring the entrance of a
                            monumental castle. I used 3D blocking for architecture and perspective, then enhanced the scene
                            with hand-painted details, photorealistic textures, and cinematic lighting.

                            These projects allowed me to refine a hybrid workflow that combines ZBrush sculpting, 2D
                            painting, and photorealistic elements to create visually rich and storytelling-oriented concept
                            art for games and media.</p>

                        <h3>Project Details</h3>
                        <p>n addition to my concept art work, I have developed several 3D character and environment projects
                            that allowed me to explore a full production workflow from sculpt to render. These projects were
                            created using the following pipeline:

                            ZBrush for high-resolution sculpting

                            Maya for retopology and clean mesh preparation

                            Mixamo for automatic rigging and posing

                            Substance Painter for texture painting and materials

                            Marvelous Designer for realistic cloth simulation

                            Blender for environment modeling and scene layout

                            Marmoset Toolbag for final rendering and presentation

                            Some of the completed character projects include:

                            An elven archer, focused on graceful anatomy and layered costuming

                            A stylized rabbit, with an expressive pose and cartoon-inspired textures

                            Sara, a modern character concept based on a bass guitarist, blending urban style and attitude

                            A fantasy king, wearing ornate robes and accessories designed to convey power and elegance

                            Each project helped me refine my understanding of the 3D pipeline, from anatomical sculpting and
                            clothing to posing, texturing, and presentation. I particularly enjoy combining realism and
                            stylization, bringing characters and environments to life in a visually engaging and technically
                            polished way.</p>

                        <h3>Project Details</h3>
                        <p>As part of my undergraduate final project, I developed a narrative-driven detective game using
                            Unity. The goal of the game is to solve a mini murder case by exploring different suspect
                            locations, gathering clues, and analyzing evidence to identify the killer.

                            The player moves between interactive environments, such as rooms in each suspect’s home, where
                            they can investigate objects, read documents, and uncover hidden items. The game features simple
                            inventory logic, dialogue sequences, and progressive clue unlocking that leads to the final
                            deduction.

                            This project allowed me to combine game design, storytelling, and programming, focusing on
                            player agency and logical thinking. It was built entirely in Unity, with C# scripts handling
                            object interactions, dialogue triggers, and state changes across the investigation.

                            This experience strengthened my understanding of game logic, scene management, and event
                            systems, while also highlighting how narrative and mechanics can work together to deliver an
                            engaging gameplay experience.</p>
